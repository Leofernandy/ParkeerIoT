## 💡 Overview

**Parkeer** is a comprehensive smart parking ecosystem that integrates a mobile application with physical hardware (IoT). Designed to solve parking congestion, the system allows users to book slots remotely, while the hardware ensures only valid bookings can access the facility.

The system synchronizes **Real-time Database** events between the Android App and the ESP32 Microcontroller to control gates, monitor slot occupancy, and manage payments instantly.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📱 Mobile Application
* **Real-time Slot Monitoring:** View slot status (**Available 🟢**, **Booked 🟡**, **Occupied 🔴**) updated instantly from hardware sensors.
* **Secure Booking System:** Reserve specific slots in advance. The app performs atomic transactions to deduct wallet balance safely.
* **QR Code Access:** Scan the QR Code displayed at the parking gate to validate booking and open the barrier.
* **Auto-Refund Policy:** If a user cancels a booking before scanning, the system automatically releases the slot and refunds the balance to the user's wallet.
* **Vehicle Management:** Register multiple vehicles for easy booking.

### 🤖 IoT Hardware (Smart Gate & Slots)
* **Automated Gate Control:** Servo motors open the gate only upon successful QR validation from the app.
* **Security Logic:** No Booking = No Entry. The buzzer alerts if an unauthorized vehicle attempts to enter.
* **Sensor Fusion:**
    * *Gate Sensors:* Detect vehicle presence at entry/exit points.
    * *Slot Sensors:* 5 IR sensors monitor individual parking spots.
* **Visual Feedback:** OLED Display shows dynamic QR codes and status messages; LEDs indicate slot status physically.

## 📅 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Android Studio (Latest Stable)
* Arduino IDE (with ESP32 Board Manager installed)
* Firebase Project (configured with both Firestore and Realtime Database)

### 1. Android Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Leofernandy/ParkeerIoTA.git](https://github.com/Leofernandy/ParkeerIoTA.git)
    ```
2.  Add your `google-services.json` file to the `app/` directory.
3.  Sync Gradle and Build the project.

### 2. Hardware (Firmware) Setup

1.  Open the `ParkingSystem_QR_Gate.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
2.  Install required libraries:
    * Firebase ESP32 Client
    * ESP32Servo
    * ESP8266 and ESP32 OLED driver for SSD1306 displays
    * QRcodeOled
3.  Create a `secrets.h` file and configure your credentials:
    ```cpp
    #define WIFI_SSID "YourWiFiName"
    #define WIFI_PASSWORD "YourWiFiPass"
    #define REFERENCE_URL "[https://your-project.firebaseio.com](https://your-project.firebaseio.com)"
    #define AUTH_TOKEN "YourDatabaseSecret"
    ```
